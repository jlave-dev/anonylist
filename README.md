# Anonylist

I developed this app for a coding test, but thought it was decent enough to stand on its own.

## Local Setup

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/jameslave/anonylist
cd anonylist
yarn
# run server and client concurrently
yarn run dev
```

Client should be accessible at http://localhost:8080.
